## About the Developer

I'm an early-career full-stack developer with a background in game development and hands-on experience with web technologies and SEO. I focus on writing clean, well-structured code and building applications that are intuitive and purposeful. Iâ€™m always looking to learn and improve, and I enjoy creating projects that reflect both technical growth and real-world problem solving.

TalentBridge was built to demonstrate my ability to take a concept from idea to working application â€” handling everything from backend logic to user experience. It highlights my full-stack capabilities and reflects a strong understanding of how to design and implement features that deliver value to users.
